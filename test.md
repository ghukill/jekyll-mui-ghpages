# Welcome!

This is a crude, stripped down jekyll site rendered through GitHub pages.  It loads [Google's MUI CSS framework](https://www.muicss.com/) via CDNs.

You are viewing the file `test.md`, from this scaffolding:
	
	├── _includes
	│   ├── footer.html
	│   └── head.html
	├── _layouts
	│   ├── default.html
	│   └── page.html
	├── README.md
	└── test.md

Thanks for playing and enjoy!

love,
Graham
